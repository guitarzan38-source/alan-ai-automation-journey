# Alan's 84-Day AI Automation Journey 🚀

From zero to deployed AI agents that save businesses 10–20 hours/week.

**Goal:** Land a role at Tesla, Neuralink, or top startup as an **AI Automation Engineer**  
**Proof:** Every single day I ship working code → right here.

### Week 1 – Python Foundations
- `week1/day1/` → File organizer (Day 1)
- `week1/day2/` → CSV cleaner + Bulk renamer (Day 2)
- `music.py` → My custom music script (bonus)

### Daily Rule
> Study 30 min → Build 20 min → Ship in browser → Sleep proud.

Live updates on X (when I feel ready): @????  
Built with ❤️ and zero terminal (because terminals hate me)

**Hiring managers:** Yes, I can show you any of these live in 5 minutes.
Add pro README – now my repo explains everything
